#AF-Interview-Challenge

This project was for a job interview at a start-up. Given a json file of vehicles, I had to build a client side and
server side to handle the user requests to see all of the vehicles in the fleet or just a select few which are chosen
by the user drawing a polygon on the map.

This challenge was before I knew HTML, CSS, or JS, thus the resulting structure of the front end.
